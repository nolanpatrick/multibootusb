# multibootusb
This repository consists of config files and other things necessary to create a USB stick capable of booting multiple operating systems in live mode using the GRUB2 bootloader.

WARNING and DISCLAIMER: This will destroy all data on the target USB drive and may cause data loss on other disks if you pick the wrong drive during setup. I am not responsible for any loss of data or other problems associated with this project.

1. To begin you must create a new MSDOS partision table on the drive you would like to use. This will wipe all data on the USB disk so make sure you back up anything important.
